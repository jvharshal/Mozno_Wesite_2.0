## 1. The Tale of Two Cousins – 2 000 Words in One Table

| Cousin | SIP (₹) | Years Contributed | Total Invested | Corpus @ 60 | Effective CAGR |
|--------|---------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Riya** | 5 000 | 10 (age 22-32) | ₹6 00 000 | **₹2.75 Cr** | 12 % |
| **Jay**  | 5 000 | 28 (age 32-60) | ₹16 80 000 | ₹1.54 Cr | 12 % |

**Key insight:** Riya **stopped** at 32, invested **one-third** the money, yet retired with **75 % more** than Jay.  
The only variable was **time**—the most powerful lever in compounding.

## 2. What Exactly Is Compounding?

Imagine a snowball rolling downhill:

- **First year**: ₹1 lakh at 12 % → ₹1.12 lakh  
- **Second year**: interest is calculated on **₹1.12 lakh** → ₹1.25 lakh  
- **Third year**: interest on **₹1.25 lakh** → ₹1.40 lakh  

Every year the **base** grows, so the **absolute interest** grows **exponentially**.

| CAGR | Money Doubles Every |
|------|---------------------|
| 6 %  | 12 years |
| 8 %  | 9 years |
| 10 % | 7.2 years |
| 12 % | 6 years |

Keep this on a sticky note; it beats calculators at dinner parties.

## 4. Frequency Matters – Daily vs. Monthly vs. Annual

| Compounding Frequency | Effective Yield @ 7 % | Extra Gain |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------|
| Annual                | 7.00 %                | –          |
| Quarterly             | 7.19 %                | 0.19 %     |
| Monthly               | 7.23 %                | 0.23 %     |
| Daily                 | 7.25 %                | 0.25 %     |

Tiny, but **free money**.

|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|
| 25        | ₹8 050                            | –                   |
