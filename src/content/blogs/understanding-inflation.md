## 2️⃣ What Exactly Is Inflation?

Inflation = **rate at which prices rise** & **purchasing power falls**.

- **CPI** tracks **retail** prices (what you & I pay).  
- **WPI** tracks **wholesale** prices (factories & traders).  
- **Core CPI** excludes volatile food & fuel.

| Year | Salary Needed to Maintain 2019 Lifestyle (₹25 k base) |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 2019 | ₹25 000 |
| 2021 | ₹28 090 |
| 2023 | ₹31 550 |
| 2025 | ₹35 450 |

If your 2025 salary is **₹35 k**, you are **exactly flat** in real terms.  
Everything else is a **nominal illusion**.
