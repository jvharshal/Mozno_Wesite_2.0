# How a Minute Change in Return Affects Your Future: Practical Examples

> “Does an extra 1 % return really matter?”  
> Let’s run the numbers on three life goals.

---

## 1. Retirement – the 30-year marathon

| CAGR | Final Corpus | Extra vs. 11 % |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| 11 % | ₹6.5 Cr | — |
| 12 % | ₹8.2 Cr | **+₹1.7 Cr** |
| 13 % | ₹10.4 Cr | **+₹3.9 Cr** |

*Visual cue*: mountain chart “₹1.7 Cr extra for just 1 % more – that’s a 3-BHK flat in the suburbs!”

## 2. Child’s education – the 10-year sprint

Need ₹40 lakh in 2034.

| CAGR | Monthly SIP Needed | Savings vs. 11 % |
|------|--------------------|------------------|
| 11 % | ₹18,000 | — |
| 12 % | ₹16,200 | **₹2.16 L less** over 10 years |

## 3. Buying a car – the 5-year short-term

Target: ₹12 lakh in 2029.

| CAGR | SIP Needed |
|------|------------|
| 8 %  | ₹16,300 |
| 9 %  | ₹15,700 |
| 10 % | ₹15,100 |

**Difference**: ₹1,200/month – a weekend dinner for two saved every month.

## 4. How to squeeze that extra 1 %

- **Switch to direct** mutual funds → saves 0.5–1 % TER  
- **Annual rebalancing** → historically adds 0.5–1 %  
- **Step-up SIP by 10 % yearly** → raises IRR by 1–1.5 %

## 5. The dark side – negative 1 %

If inflation unexpectedly rises by 1 %, an 8 % FD real return drops to 1 % (7 % CPI).  
Over 20 years, ₹1 Cr becomes **₹27 L less** in real terms.

## 📦 Take-Away Box

> Compounding amplifies **tiny differences**.  
> Focus on cost, asset allocation, and discipline; the extra 1 % will often take care of itself.
