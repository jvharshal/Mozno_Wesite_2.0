# Goal-Based Planning: Turning Dreams into Achievable Targets

You don‚Äôt drift to the top of Everest; you climb with a map, a schedule, and oxygen tanks.  
Your money goals need the same discipline.

---

## 1. Write Down SMART Goals
**S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**elevant, **T**ime-bound.

> Bad goal: ‚ÄúSave for my child.‚Äù  
> SMART goal:  
> *‚ÄúAccumulate ‚Çπ25 lakh (2024 money) for my daughter‚Äôs U.S. undergrad by July 2033.‚Äù*

---

## 2. Step-by-Step Framework

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **List** | Emergency, short, medium, long-term buckets |
| **Inflate** | Adjust every target for inflation (use CPI data) |
| **Choose** | Pick instruments by horizon |
| **Calculate** | Use SIP calculators or `PMT` in Excel |
| **Automate** | Separate SIPs, label them, step-up annually |

---

## 3. Horizon-Based Instruments

| Horizon | Instrument |
|---------|------------|
| < 1 yr | Liquid funds, FDs |
| 1‚Äì3 yrs | Short-term debt funds |
| 3‚Äì5 yrs | Hybrid aggressive funds |
| 5 yrs+ | Equity mutual funds, index funds |

## 4. Real-World Case ‚Äì The Patels‚Äô Three Goals

| Goal | Year | Future Value | Monthly SIP @11 % |
|------|------|--------------|-------------------|
| Europe Trip | 2026 | ‚Çπ4 L | ‚Çπ14,500 |
| Daughter‚Äôs PG | 2039 | ‚Çπ75 L | ‚Çπ12,000 |
| Retirement | 2055 | ‚Çπ8 Cr | ‚Çπ18,000 |
| **Total** |  |  | **‚Çπ44,500** |

> Harsh‚Äôs take-home: ‚Çπ1.2 L ‚Üí plan is feasible.

## 5. Managing Trade-offs

If Harsh loses his job:

1. **Pause** Europe SIP, **not** education  
2. **Use** emergency fund  
3. **Resume** higher SIPs once income stabilises

## 6. Tools & Trackers

- **Apps**: Kuvera, Groww (tag goals)  
- **Sheet**: Colour-coded Google Sheet  
  - Green ‚â• 100 % on track  
  - Amber 90‚Äì99 %  
  - Red < 90 %

## üì¶ Take-Away Box

> A goal **without a number** is just a wish.  
> Write it, inflate it, SIP it, review it.  
> That‚Äôs how dreams turn into **down-payment receipts** and **convocation-day smiles**.
